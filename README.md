This repo is mostly to make sure I can make stuff with Makestuff. 

Goal is to create a couple R scripts, where the interesting one is a simulation but there are different parameter sets that generate different outputs when called appropriately (Dushoff calls this a "fork"). 

I will try to edit files in Rstudio and vim. I started writing this in vim.
